# Task Management App

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Features

- Add, edit, and delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed or incomplete
- Sort tasks by priority (high, medium, low)
- Automatically persist tasks using localStorage
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS and daisyUI components

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js** for server-side rendering and page navigation.
- **TypeScript** for type safety.
- **Tailwind CSS** and **daisyUI** for responsive design.
- **React Icons** for icons (edit, delete, etc.).
- **LocalStorage** for persisting tasks across sessions.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-management-app.git
  ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd task-management-app
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
4. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
